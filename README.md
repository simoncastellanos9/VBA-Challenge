# VBA-Challenge
The attached script loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information.

- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

There is also a conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

The solution is able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".

The script can also run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.

The results for this script can be seen in the attached image files titled: "2014-Results", "2015 Results" and "2016-Results"
